# GLOBE ADVENTURE

## High-Level Summary
The **Globe Adventure** project, developed by **Team Phoenix**, is an interactive, app-based educational game designed for primary to high school students. This immersive game transforms learning about science and the environment into an epic journey. The project educates students about the **Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) Program** protocols. It helps students understand the world around them, develop awareness of local and global environmental issues, investigate their local communities, and learn scientific principles.

## Project Details

### How We Addressed the Challenge
In response to the challenge, we developed **Globe Adventure**, a cross-platform educational application. This tool is designed to engage students in an interactive learning experience that:
- Builds awareness of local and global environmental issues.
- Empowers students to investigate their communities using **GLOBE** protocols.
- Facilitates learning of scientific principles in a fun and engaging way.

### How Does It Work?
Participants engage in a learning journey that unfolds through multiple stages, offering an immersive and educational experience.

1. **Profile Creation**
   Players start by creating their profiles to continue with the game.

2. **Main Components**
   The game consists of three major components:
   - **Learn Section**: A space to acquire knowledge through videos and information about Earth systems.
   - **Explore Section**: An area to investigate local and global environmental topics, using **NASA Earth Observatory** data.
   - **Training Section**: A place for players to test and train their knowledge through interactive exercises.

   Additional features include:
   - **Daily Task**: Players are provided with daily challenges that reward them with coins.
   - **Community Section**: A space where players can connect with others, form groups, and see their leaderboard rankings.
   - **Data Explore Section**: A dedicated section for exploring environmental data using NASA tools and **GLOBE** protocols.

3. **Learning and Exploration**
   - The journey begins with a visual representation of the Earth system called **About Globe**, where players learn through videos and information.
   - After completing the learning phase, players engage in puzzle games, which, upon completion, unlock the **Explore** section.

### Development Process
We followed an agile development model, using **Material Design** principles and a monolithic architecture. The application was developed using **Dart** and **Flutter**, making it accessible across multiple platforms.

### Benefits
The **Globe Adventure** program is both an engaging game and an effective learning tool. It ensures users fully understand topics like the **water cycle** and **climate change** by requiring them to complete the associated learning modules before accessing the gameâ€™s interactive sections.

### What Do We Hope to Achieve?
We aim to foster a generation of environmentally-conscious, well-informed students who are equipped to tackle global environmental challenges.
